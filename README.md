# SQL for Data Analysis

This repository contains SQL scripts and queries developed during my data analytics training. The exercises and mini-projects simulate real-world tasks such as data cleaning, transformation, joins, and business insight generation.

## üîê Security and Encryption Utilities

Inside the `sql` folder, you'll find scripts focused on basic SQL Server security and encryption setup. These are useful for:

- Auditing user roles at both the database and server level
- Viewing asymmetric keys
- Creating a master key and certificate for secure environments
- Verifying connection encryption status
- Referencing an encrypted SQL Server connection string

üìÑ **Script:** [`SQLQuery14sql.sql`](https://github.com/jeisteve999/SQL-for-Data-Analysis/blob/main/sql/SQLQuery14sql.sql)

### üß© Script Contents
