# 🧠 SQL for Data Analysis

Welcome to my **SQL for Data Analysis** repository!  
This repo contains a curated collection of **SQL Server scripts** developed during my journey through data analytics training.

🛠️ It includes hands-on exercises and mini-projects that simulate real-world data tasks such as:

- ✅ Data cleaning & transformation  
- 🧩 Joins & subqueries  
- 📊 Business analysis  
- 🔁 Control flow & procedures  
- 🔐 Security configurations  
- 🧱 Normalization & relational design  

All scripts are written in **T-SQL** and tested in **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**.
