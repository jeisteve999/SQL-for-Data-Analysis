## üìò Contents

### 1. System Information
- Print messages with `SELECT`
- View SQL Server version with `@@VERSION`
- Get current date and extract components (`DATENAME`, `GETDATE`)

### 2. System Metadata
- Explore views like `sys.databases`, `sys.schemas`, `sys.syslanguages`
- Use replication/system monitoring views (`spt_monitor`, `MSreplication_options`) where applicable

### 3. Language Settings
- Set query language context (e.g. `SET LANGUAGE 'Spanish'`)

### 4. Table Creation
- Create two example tables: `empleados` and `estudiantes` with relevant data types

### 5. Data Insertion
- Insert single and multiple rows
- Insert using `OUTPUT INSERTED` to return values after insert

---

## ‚úÖ Requirements

- Microsoft SQL Server (2016 or later recommended)
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or any T-SQL compatible interface
- Optional: Access to AdventureWorks sample database for system views

---

## üöß Notes

- Some system tables (like `MSreplication_options`) only appear in certain SQL Server setups.
- Be cautious when modifying system databases such as `master`.
- Adapt column names and table structures if integrating into your own environment.
- Script uses English for all commands and comments for consistency and clarity.

# SQL Server Flow Control and UNION Practice

This script demonstrates intermediate SQL Server features including control flow using labels and `GOTO`, conditional updates, use of the `RAND()` function, and combining result sets using `UNION`. It is designed for learners exploring logic and procedural behavior in T-SQL.

---  https://github.com/jeisteve999/SQL-for-Data-Analysis/blob/main/basic_practice/sql_flow_and_union_practice.sql

## üìò Contents

### 1. Insert Example (System Database)
- Demonstrates a template-style `INSERT INTO` on a system table (`msdb`)  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è For educational purposes only ‚Äì avoid modifying system databases in production

### 2. Update Operations
- Updates `empleados` table with:
  - Automatic `fecha_baja` set to current date
  - Simultaneous update of multiple fields

### 3. UNION Query
- Combines results from three different tables (`bebidas`, `platos`, `camareros`)
- Uses `UNION` and `ORDER BY` to sort merged data

### 4. Random Loop with GOTO
- Simulates a loop using:
  - `DECLARE` and `SET` for variables
  - `RAND()` to generate random numbers
  - `GOTO` control flow to simulate iteration
  - Stops after 5 loops with final message

---

## ‚úÖ Requirements

- Microsoft SQL Server 2016 or later
- Any T-SQL-compatible client (e.g., SSMS)
- Optional: Custom schema containing `empleados`, `bebidas`, `platos`, and `camareros`

---

## üöß Notes

- Some system tables used (`msdb`, `autoadmin_task_agents`) are reserved for SQL Server internal use.
- Always validate and test code in a development environment before using in production.
- Ensure tables like `empleados` and `camareros` exist in your database.

# SQL Server Practice Lab: Database Design, Normalization & Security

## üìå Overview

This project is a comprehensive SQL Server practice script designed to demonstrate essential skills in:

- **Database creation**
- **Table design and normalization (1NF, 2NF)**
- **Data manipulation (INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE)**
- **Primary and foreign key constraints**
- **Composite keys and indexing**
- **User roles and permissions**
- **Database backups**

All scripts are written for learning purposes using a fictional dataset related to employees, faculty, courses, clients, and orders.

---

## üß± Structure

The script is divided into **8 key sections**:

### 1. Employee Table and Operations
- Create a basic employee table
- Insert single and multiple rows
- Update and delete data
- Query data by ID

### 2. Faculty and Course Relationship
- Create a non-normalized faculty table with course info
- Perform data cleanup
- Normalize course information into a separate table

### 3. Clients and Address Normalization
- Transition from a flat table to a 1-to-many relationship
- Use foreign key constraints to enforce integrity

### 4. 2NF Orders Example
- Refactor a table with partial dependencies
- Separate clients into a dedicated table and apply normalization rules

### 5. Referential Integrity with PK and FK
- Create `Faculty1` and `Courses1` with `IDENTITY` and proper foreign keys
- Perform INNER JOIN queries

### 6. Composite Primary Keys
- Demonstrate multi-column primary key with `SSN` and `EId`

### 7. Indexes and User Roles
- Add a unique non-clustered index
- Create SQL Server login and assign user roles
- Grant database-level access

### 8. Backup Instructions
- Backup database to local path
- Use INIT and STATS for clean backup

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**
- **T-SQL**
